# Snake game
This project was created as part of the Udemy course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" that I did in my free time.
It was a fun project, and the first time I used a GUI in Python (Turtle Graphics). 
The is simple but works well - it includes all the classic aspects, a snake that grows longer for every "bit" it eats, and dies if you hit a wall or the snake's own tail.
The game also keeps score on how many bites the snake has grown.
When losing the game simply restarts and the score resets, making it easier to keep playing.
